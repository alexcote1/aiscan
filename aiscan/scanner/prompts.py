# Function Analysis Prompt
FUNCTION_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are a code analysis expert responsible for understanding and documenting the behavior of functions.

Given the following function code, its file's imports, and information about any functions it calls, provide a detailed analysis of:
1. Function summary - What does this function do?
2. Potential vulnerabilities - What security risks might this function introduce?
3. Logic flaws - Are there any logical issues or edge cases not handled?
4. Data flow - How does data move through this function?

IMPORTANT: Dependency Order Analysis
This function's dependencies (child functions) have already been analyzed, and their analysis is provided below.
Always use this information to build a comprehensive analysis of the current function.

When analyzing the function:
1. Consider the behavior and security implications of all called functions
2. Document how the function interacts with its child functions
3. Note any potential issues that arise from the combination of this function and its child functions
4. Include relevant context from child functions in your analysis
5. For each child function's vulnerability:
   - Document if the vulnerability is mitigated in this function
   - If mitigated, explain how (e.g., input sanitization, validation, etc.)
   - If not mitigated, explain why it's still relevant
   - If partially mitigated, explain what's still at risk
6. For each child function's logic flaw:
   - Document if the flaw is addressed in this function
   - If addressed, explain how
   - If not addressed, explain why it's still relevant
7. For each child function's data flow:
   - Document how data flows between this function and child functions
   - Note any transformations or validations of data
   - Highlight any potential data integrity issues

File Imports:
```
{imports}
```

Child Functions Analysis:
```
{child_functions_context}
```

Function Code:
```
{code}
```

Be thorough and precise, focusing on the function's actual behavior and its interaction with child functions.

# Generic Function Call Analysis Prompt

FUNCTION_CALL_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are a code analysis expert tasked with identifying function calls within a given piece of code.

Your goal is to analyze the provided code and extract all function calls. For each function call identified, provide:
- **Fully Qualified Name:** Use the format `module.function` or `component.method`
- **Line Number:** The line where the call occurs
- **Call Type:** Either "direct" or "imported"

Example:
```python
from myapp.utils import process_data
from internal.auth import validate_token
from custom_processor import transform

# These are function calls:
process_data()           # Direct call
validate_token()        # Imported call
transform()             # Imported call
```

File Imports:
```
{imports}
```

Code to analyze:
{code}

ONLY INCLUDE CALLABLE OBJECTS.
EXCLUDE all well know 3rd party modules or builtins such as print, len, sqlite3, boto3, hashlib, etc. structs that are not functions (and dont have code) such as request.form do not need to be included. 
if you include any of above you might lose your certification as a code analysis expert.
"""

# Function Extraction Prompt
FUNCTION_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a code parsing expert responsible for extracting individual functions from source code.

Given the following code from a file named '{file_name}' (module: {module_name}, full path: {full_module_path}), identify and extract all functions, methods, or procedures.

For each function, provide:
1. The function name (including any module prefix if it's an imported function)
2. The complete function code (including docstrings, comments, and implementation)
3. The approximate start and end line numbers
4. Whether this function is likely a user entry point (e.g., has route decorators like @app.route, @api.route, etc.)
5. when it has decorators or comments above the functions that are about the function include those lines. 

Entry Point Indicators (mark as entry point if ANY of these are present):
1. Web Framework Route Decorators:
   - Flask: @app.route, @blueprint.route, @mod_*.route

   - Django: @api_view, class-based views, @permission_classes
   - Express: app.get, app.post, router.*
   - Any function decorated with a route or endpoint decorator

2. API Endpoint Decorators:
   - REST API decorators (@api_view, @action, etc.)
   - GraphQL resolvers (@resolver, @query, @mutation)
   - WebSocket handlers (@websocket, @socketio.on)
   - Any function that handles HTTP requests

   - Any function decorated with @event_handler or similar

4. File Upload/Download Handlers:
   - Functions that handle file uploads
   - Functions that serve file downloads
   - Any function that processes file operations

5. Webhook Endpoints:
   - Functions that handle webhook callbacks
   - Integration endpoints
   - Any function that receives external callbacks
6. Anything else that would typically be an entry point for untrusted data:
    - recieved from a message bus
    - recieved from a websocket
    - anything else if you are confident that it would be an entry point for untrusted data.
    - decorators that would modify requests/responses from other functions, after_request, before_requests, ETC. 

If there are no clear functions, return an empty list.

Here's the code:
```
{code}

# Function Matching Prompt
FUNCTION_MATCHING_PROMPT = """You are a code analysis expert responsible for matching function calls across different files.

Given a source function '{source_func}' and a list of possible target functions, determine which one is most likely to be the same function.
Consider the following matching criteria:

1. Exact name match (highest priority)
2. Module prefix match (e.g., libapi.keygen matches keygen in libapi.py)
3. Function signature similarity
4. Context and usage patterns
5. Import statements and module relationships

Context about the source function:
Module: {module_name}
Full path: {full_module_path}
Imports:
```
{imports}
```

Source function: {source_func}
Target functions: {target_funcs}

For each target function, provide:
1. The exact function name that best matches
2. A confidence score (0-100)
3. The matching criteria used
4. Any relevant context that supports the match

Return a JSON object with:
{
    "matches": [
        {
            "target": "libapi.exact_function_name",
            "confidence": 95,
            "criteria": ["exact_name", "module_prefix"],
            "context": "relevant context"
        }
    ]
}

If no good matches are found, return {"matches": []}"""

# Security Analysis Prompt
SECURITY_PROMPT = """You are a security code analyzer with expertise in identifying high-confidence security issues. Your goal is to minimize both false positives and false negatives.

Analysis Guidelines:
1. Only report findings when you are highly confident (>90%% certainty) that there is a genuine security issue.
2. If no security issues are found, return an empty findings array: {{"findings": []}}
3. For each potential issue, consider:
   - Is this a clear and unambiguous security vulnerability?
   - Can you provide specific evidence from the code?
   - Is the impact concrete and verifiable?
   - Is the fix clear and implementable?

4. Do NOT report:
   - Potential issues without clear evidence
   - Style or best practice issues without security impact
   - Theoretical vulnerabilities without practical exploit paths
   - Issues that require assumptions about the runtime environment
   - Parameterized queries using proper database APIs
   - Safe string formatting when using proper database APIs
   - ORM queries that use proper parameter binding
   - "No Security Vulnerability Found" as a finding - if no issues are found, return an empty findings list

5. When analyzing functions that call other functions:
   - Consider the security implications of all called functions
   - For each vulnerability in a called function:
     * If the vulnerability is properly mitigated in this function (e.g., through input sanitization, validation, etc.), document this mitigation
     * If the vulnerability is not mitigated, report it with the parent function's context
     * If the vulnerability is partially mitigated, report both the mitigation and remaining risk
     * If you believe a vulnerability should be fixed in the child function instead, report it as an informational finding with that recommendation
   - Include relevant context from called functions in your findings
   - Consider the data flow between the current function and its called functions
   - Document any security-relevant transformations of data between functions
   - Note any security controls or mitigations implemented in this function
   - Any relevant analysis you have about the code that you feel is important you should include as an informational finding, but focus on real findings. 

6. For each finding, include:
   - The specific vulnerability or issue
   - Where it originates (this function or a child function)
   - Whether it's mitigated in this function
   - If mitigated, how it's mitigated
   - If not mitigated, why it's still relevant
   - If partially mitigated, what's still at risk
   - Recommended fixes and their preferred location (this function or child function)

SQL Injection Detection Rules:
1. SAFE PATTERNS (DO NOT FLAG):
   - Using parameterized queries with placeholders
   - Using named parameters
   - Using ORM parameter binding
   - Using proper database API methods for parameter binding

2. UNSAFE PATTERNS (FLAG AS VULNERABILITY):
   - String concatenation in SQL queries
   - Direct string interpolation
   - Using string formatting with user input
   - Using raw SQL with user input

File Path Security Rules:
1. UNSAFE PATTERNS (FLAG AS VULNERABILITY):
   - Using user input directly in file paths
   - String formatting with user input in paths
   - Path concatenation with user input
   - Any file operations using unsanitized user input
   - Creating files with user-controlled names
   - Reading files with user-controlled paths

2. SAFE PATTERNS (DO NOT FLAG):
   - Using path manipulation functions to extract just the filename
   - Using path manipulation functions to resolve to absolute path
   - Using path manipulation functions to normalize paths
   - Using path manipulation functions with sanitized inputs
   - Using a whitelist of allowed filenames
   - Using a secure temporary directory

Focus Areas (only report if highly confident):
1. Input validation and sanitization
2. Authentication and authorization
3. Data encryption and sensitive data handling
4. SQL injection and other injection vulnerabilities
5. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
6. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
7. Secure communication
8. Error handling and logging
9. Code quality and maintainability
10. Dependencies and third-party libraries
11. Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities
12. Path traversal vulnerabilities
13. File operation security

Called Functions Analysis:
{called_functions_analysis}

File Imports:
```
{imports}
```

Code to analyze:
{code}

Only include findings where you have:
1. Clear evidence in the code
2. High confidence in the assessment
3. Specific, actionable fixes
4. Concrete security impact

Remember: If no security issues are found, return {{"findings": []}}
